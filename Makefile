# -*- makefile-bsdmake -*-

# This Makefile (and its associated include files) works with NetBSD Make and
# Simon Gerraty's Bmake & Mk-files from http://www.crufty.net/FreeWare/, and
# with FreeBSD make with caveats.  For many systems the bmake included in pkgsrc
# will also work (see https://pkgsrc.org/).
#
# See:  http://www.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/help/bmake.htm
#
# Pkgsrc will install on a vast number of systems, including MS-Windows with
# Cygwin.  Similarly Simon's Bmake works on most any Unix or Unix-like system.
#
# You should use $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX so as to build everything elsewhere outside
# of, or within a single sub-directory, of the source tree (i.e. instead of
# polluting the source itself tree with "obj" sub-directories everywhere).
#
#	mkdir build
#	export MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build
#	export WITH_AUTO_OBJ=yes		# just for FreeBSD, sigh.
#	b(sd)make
#
# N.B.:  Some variants of BSD Make treat $MAKEOBJDIR as a sub-directory under
# /usr/obj, and others treat it as a sub-directory under ${.CURDIR}, even if it
# starts with a '/'!  You have been warned.  As with $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX some
# older versions also only allow it to be set in the environment.  You should
# just use $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX, set in the environment (except on OpenBSD since
# 5.5, where $MAKEOBJDIR is necessary).
#
# Optionally you may change the final installation heriarchy from the default of
# "/usr" to any path prefix of your choice by setting PREFIX on the make command
# lines, like this (or optionally in the environment):
#
#	b(sd)make PREFIX=/opt/pkg
#
# Then if the build succeeds (and assuming you're not cross-compiling) you can
# run the regression tests to see if the results are correct.
#
#	b(sd)make regress
#
# Finally to install the results into a "dist" subtree (which you can then
# distribute as a binary distribution that can be un-packed in the root of a
# target system) you can do:
#
#	b(sd)make DESTDIR=$(pwd -P)/dist install
#	cd dist && tar -cf ../dist.tar .
#
# DESTDIR can of course be any directory, e.g. /usr/local, especially if PREFIX
# is set to an empty string (PREFIX=""), but note the design is such that the
# package can be installed at build time into a private DESTDIR (as above), then
# archived and the resulting archive can be extracted at the root of the target
# system's filesystem.  The default with PREFIX="/usr" will install into the
# base of a typical unix filesystem, while something like PREFIX="/usr/pkg" will
# install into a typical package installation direcory, and PREFIX="/usr/local"
# (with DESTDIR=$(pwd -P)/dist) will be the equivalent of PREFIX="" and
# DESTDIR="/usr/local", the difference being the latter does an immediate
# install on the build system, while the former allows the DESTDIR to be
# archived and then extracted on any suitable target system.
#
# (This is not the normal use of DESTDIR in BSD Make, but it is the best way for
# out-of-tree builds, and it matches the way pkgsrc now works internally.)
#
# WARNING:  Do not specify DESTDIR for the main build nor the regress target!

#
# Building Documentation:
#
# The documentation is all currently within comments in the source code and we
# use Cxref to extract it and turn it into something more useful and coherent,
# which by default is a set of HTML pages.  This has the added advantage of
# providing a comprehensive hyperlinked cross-reference of all the types and
# functions in all of the source files.
#
# If your Bmake system defined MKDOC, but you do not have Cxref, you can disable
# the building and installation of the HTML documentation by setting "MKDOC=no"
# on the Bmake command line or in the environment, or by uncommenting the
# following line:
#
#MKDOC = no
#
# Cxref can be found at:  https://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/cxref/

#
# Special Notes for Special Systems:
#
# MacOS vs. various BMakes:
#
# OSX, aka macOS, since use of Xcode 10(?) doesn't have a working bsdmake in the
# base system, nor does the one installable from Homebrew work.  However the
# version of Bmake that can be installed from Homebrew does mostly(*) work (and
# presumably a manual install of Simon's Bmake will also work).  Unfortunately
# the Bmake that comes with pkgsrc does not work properly on macOS.
#
# Pkgsrc does not include Simon's MK files, but rather the bootstrap-mk-files
# package, which (as of 20180901) are not yet fully ported to OSX/Darwin (it is
# more or less just an out-of-date copy of the non-portable NetBSD MK files).
# So, if one can do without the shared library then one can use the pkgsrc bmake
# on macOS, and depending on the vintage of one's pkgsrc, it may also be
# necessary to pass "SHLIB_MAJOR= SHLIB_MINOR= SHLIB_TEENY=" on the command line
# or in Makefile.inc.
#
# The really old Apple bsdmake and mk-files do generate the correct shared
# library names, but they don't support .WAIT in the ${SUBDIR} list.
#
# OpenBSD:
#
# So note OpenBSD's make since 5.5 (and before 2.1) does NOT support
# $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX at all.  For recent OpenBSD, just use ${MAKEOBJDIR} instead.
#
# FreeBSD:
#
# FreeBSD's make (or rather their mk-files) is too broken to do the right thing
# with "obj" in the target list for "all".  Their saving grace (as of at least
# 12.0) is they've implemented WITH_AUTO_OBJ, and it works, BUT ONLY IF YOU PUT
# "WITH_AUTO_OBJ=yes" ON THE COMMAND LINE OR IN THE ENVIRONMENT!
#
# Other BMake ports:
#
# See the first use of .WAIT below for comments about really old BMakes and
# mk-files that don't deal with it properly.
#
#####################
#
# More about using $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX:
#
# Using $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX requires always invoking the build again with
# $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX set in the environment, and set to the same directory if you
# want to rebuild or continue a build.
#
# If you want to run make in just a sub-directory of the source tree AFTER
# you've done an initial build (or at least after you've done an initial run of
# "make obj") then you can do so provided you carefully set $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX to
# the the pathname of the initial build directory you created.
#
# Remember BSD Make tries to change to ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}${.CURDIR} to any
# rules, so if you use a fully qualified pathname then you can use the exact
# same $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX no matter where you are in the project hierarchy.  If
# the build directory is also a sub-directory of the project's source hierarchy
# then you can also use a relative path to it from within a sub-directory.
#
# Note that setting $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX in your shell's environment may risk
# mixing things up for different projects, though if your BSD Make does
# correctly set ${.CURDIR} to the canonical fully qualified current working
# directory where it was started from, and if you have set $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX to
# a fully qualified pathname, then this could be a good way to share use of a
# fast scratch filesystem for builds of many different projects using BSD
# Makefiles.
#
# If you mess things up and end up with generated files in your source directory
# then run "make cleandir" to start over.
#
#####################
#
# How to do without $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX:
#
# If you don't use $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX then "obj.${MACHINE}" sub-directories will
# be created for each directory with products.  EXCEPT ON FreeBSD!!!  (where the
# default is always just "obj", BUT IT IS BROKEN! (as of 12.0)).
#
# If you end up with "obj.*" sub-directories and you want to go back to using a
# 'build' directory (as would be sane to do) then you can remove all the obj.*
# detritus with this command (the trailing, escaped, semicolon is important!):
#
#	find . -type d -name .git -prune -o -type d ! -name .git ! -name 'obj*' -exec rm -rf {}obj {}/obj.$(uname -m) \;
#
#####################
#
# The history of MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX is a bit convoluted.
#
# The original BSD's "PMake" from CSRG (right up to 4.4BSD-Lite2) did not
# support MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX at all.
#
# The first support appears to come in FreeBSD with r18339 (of make/main.c) by
# Steven Wallace on 1996-09-17.  This corresponds to about FreeBSD-2.2.1, I
# think.
#
# However the initial implementation in FreeBSD's original make since 2.2.1 when
# they first gain support, and up to about May 2014, or in 9.0; and as merged in
# NetBSD's make since (effectively) 1.5 (literally since 1.3) and prior to 7.0
# (and so in Simon's Bmake since its inception, and up to bmake-20140214); and
# in OpenBSD's make since 2.1 when they first gained support up until 5.5 (after
# which they removed all support for MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX, a change not documented
# until 6.7!!!) were all extremely beligerent about having $MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX set
# in the environment and only in the environment -- they refused to even peek at
# it if it is only set on the command line, using only getenv(3) to access it.
#
# However in all but OpenBSD this has been fixed so that MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX can
# also be set on the command line.  I think.  I have had bad experiences with
# some versions (e.g. claiming to support setting it on the command line, but in fact
# not supporting that at all.
